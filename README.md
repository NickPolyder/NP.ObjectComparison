# ObjectPatcher
This repository serves as a library that will make Object Patching and diff easier.


# Roadmap

- Add PatchInfo as return value to include more detailed patch information.
- Amend the Property patch to follow the visitor pattern 
- Consider creating diff functionality as well ? (That can commit after ? )
