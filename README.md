# ObjectComparison
This repository serves as a library that will make Object Patching and diff easier.


## Roadmap

- ~~Add PatchInfo as return value to include more detailed patch information.~~
- ~~Consider creating diff functionality as well ? (That can commit after ? )~~
- ~~Finish Depth functionality on Patch~~
- ~~Add Depth functionality on Diff code~~
- ~~Maybe make a Diff functionality that can apply the patch later by calling a method ?~~ 
- Figure out how to publish alpha packages outside of nuget.org
- Unit Tests
