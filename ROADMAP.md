# Roadmap

- ~~Add PatchInfo as return value to include more detailed patch information.~~
- ~~Consider creating diff functionality as well ? (That can commit after ? )~~
- ~~Finish Depth functionality on Patch~~
- ~~Add Depth functionality on Diff code~~
- ~~Maybe make a Diff functionality that can apply the patch later by calling a method ?~~ 
- ~~Figure out how to publish alpha packages outside of nuget.org~~
- ~~Make a Decorator that will provide the full comparison functionality~~
- ~~Add AutoAnalyze in HasChanges~~
- ~~Make Factory extensions~~
- ~~Make the README better~~
- ~~Make Ignore Attributes etc~~
	- ~~Make analyzer settings take a Default factory.~~
-  ~~Give the option to also revert a patch (is it possible?)~~
   - ~~If these 2 work we can go one step further and keep a history of DiffAnalysisResults that can be applied or get reverted ?~~
- ~~Make a Memento object that will keep the history of the changes ?~~
- ~~Rename Skip to Ignore to follow general naming conventions.~~
- Include Handlers that subscribe to the Current if it inherits from `INotifyPropertyChanged`
- Make the Comparison Tracker to have an index that will return the change tracking of that field like (ComparisonTracker["path.to.property"]) 
- Make the comparison tracker to make use of the WeakReference class.
- Make examples and samples 
- Unit Tests
